    "By submitting this assignment, it is hereby declared that all group members listed above have contributed to the solution, either with code that appear in the final solution below, or with code that has been evaluated and compared to the final solution, but for some reason has been excluded. It is also declared that all project members fully understand all parts of the final solution and can explain it upon request.\n",

    "It is furthermore declared that the submitted assignment will not be shared during the course, with any individual other than the group members listed above and teachers of the course ID2214/FID3214. In particular, the assignment will not be uploaded to any public repository. The submitted assignment can be shared after the course only if written consent has been provided by the course responsible of ID2214/FID3214.\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "All parts of the assignment starting with number 1 below are mandatory. Satisfactory solutions\n",
    "will give 1 point (in total). If they in addition are good (all parts work more or less \n",
    "as they should), completed on time (submitted before the deadline in Canvas) and according\n",
    "to the instructions, together with satisfactory solutions of all parts of the assignment starting \n",
    "with number 2 below, then the assignment will receive 2 points (in total).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you do not have to develop the code directly within the notebook\n",
    "but may instead copy the comments and test cases to a more convenient development environment\n",
    "and when everything works as expected, you may paste your functions into this\n",
    "notebook, do a final testing (all cells should succeed) and submit the whole notebook \n",
